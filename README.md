- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MediaStreamer (C# .Net) [sealkeen.github.io](https://sealkeen.github.io)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Angular, ASP.Net Core, Node.JS, Docker, Kubernetes
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Sound Production
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Front-End development

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: about.me/sealkeen
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never wanted to make any web-sites (or resources) using C#, I felt like this is the worst language for that but right now It is probably the main purpose and the use case for it.
